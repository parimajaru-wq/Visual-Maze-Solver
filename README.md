# Visual Maze Solver

A Python-based visualization of the **Recursive Backtracking (Depth-First Search)** algorithm. This tool demonstrates how a computer "thinks" while navigating through a maze and allows users to **custom-design their own layouts**.



## 🌟 Key Features
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Real-time display of path exploration and backtracking.
- **Customizable Maze Design**: Design your own maze by simply editing a text grid in the source code.
- **Auto-Detection**: Dynamically finds the Start (`s`) and Exit (`e`) points.

## 🛠 Prerequisites & Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. This project requires the `pygame` library for visualization.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
pip install pygame
